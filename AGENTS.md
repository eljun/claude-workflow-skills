# Workflow Skills Project Instructions

## Purpose

This repository packages a memory-first development workflow as Agent Skills installable with Vercel `npx skills`.

The workflow stages are:

1. `task`
2. `implement`
3. `simplify`
4. `test`
5. `document`
6. `ship`
7. `release`

The core workflow is agent-neutral. Runtime-specific behavior for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, or other agents belongs in `adapters/`.

## Instruction Hierarchy

Follow this precedence order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. The active workflow `SKILL.md`
3. Runtime adapter docs in `adapters/`
4. Explanatory docs such as `README.md`

`.claude/` configuration and `.claude-plugin/` metadata are compatibility and install surfaces. They do not define portable workflow semantics.

## Workflow Philosophy

- Use task documents as shared working memory between stages.
- Keep each stage focused on one responsibility.
- Prefer concise, high-signal instructions over large orchestration frameworks.
- Preserve human review before implementation.
- Separate skill installation from model or reasoning selection.
- Use execution tiers in core workflow language: `fast`, `balanced`, and `deep`.

## Task Document Rules

Task documents live in `docs/task/`.

The `task` stage creates or updates a task document, updates `TASKS.md`, and then stops. It must not start implementation.

Implementation can begin only after task review is complete and the task document has been approved by the user. `implement auto` is the only supported automation entry point, and it assumes an approved task document already exists.

Test reports live in `docs/testing/`.

## TASKS.md Tracker Discipline

`TASKS.md` is shared state across stages, sessions, and headless runs. A stale row blocks downstream automation that gates on task status. Every stage that changes status must:

1. Move the task row out of its current section and into the next section in the same edit.
2. Re-read `TASKS.md` after the edit and confirm the row is in the new section and absent from prior sections. Retry the edit if the move did not land.
3. Never silently leave the row in an earlier section because intermediate stages were skipped. `ship` self-heals from any earlier section and discloses skipped stages in the PR body and handoff.

## Project Memory

`LEARNINGS.md` is the mutable project knowledge base. If it exists, workflow stages should read it before making decisions that could repeat known mistakes.

If `LEARNINGS.md` does not exist, do not pretend it does. Create it only when a workflow stage captures a reusable project lesson.

Use `AGENTS.md` for stable project-level instructions. Use `LEARNINGS.md` for accumulated lessons, repeated mistakes, project patterns, and durable implementation notes.

## Adapter Boundaries

Adapters may document:

- install commands for a specific agent
- runtime invocation style
- permission examples
- model or reasoning-tier mappings
- tool availability and setup notes

Adapters must not redefine the core workflow stages, task-review requirement, task document paths, or execution-tier vocabulary.

## Stop And Ask

Stop and ask the user instead of improvising when:

- a task document is missing or has not been approved for implementation
- the requested change conflicts with `AGENTS.md` or the active `SKILL.md`
- a required verification step cannot run and no safe fallback exists
- install discovery through `npx skills` breaks
- a change would require maintaining duplicate unsynchronized skill files
- a runtime-specific command is needed but not documented in an adapter
- the requested operation is destructive or would overwrite unrelated user work
